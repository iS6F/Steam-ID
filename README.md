# Steam ID Generator/Checker
**Simple Steam ID generator/checker created in Python, Generates/checks short Steam ID's, [3 to 5] characters. 
Coded in under 15 lines, 2 Versions, One for desktop use and other for replit.com, Both versions are really lightweight and efficient, Enjoy.**

*Edit the username length from this line*
```py
len = 3 
# 3 means 3 characters and so on
```

*i reccomend going for 4 letters cause they are way easier to find and 3 letters are almost all equiped, i also reccomend using replit.com to run this, steam might lag a a little if you kept this program runing for a long time, Have fun :)*
